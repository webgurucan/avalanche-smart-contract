# Writing Smart Contracts on Avalanche

## Introduction

Avalanche is an open-source platform for launching decentralized applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Avalanche gives you complete control on both the network and application layers&mdash;helping you build anything you can imagine.

Avalanche can do anything a typical Ethereum client can by using the Ethereum-standard RPC calls. The immediate benefits of using Avalanche rather than Ethereum are speed, scale and throughput. Avalanche offers thousands of transactions per second with sub-second finality at inexpensive fees. These properties will considerably improve the performance of DApps and the user experience of smart-contracts.

The goal of this guide is to lay out a best-practices regarding writing, testing and deploying smart-contracts to Avalanche. We'll be building smart contracts with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) which is an Avalanche development environment for professionals.

## Prerequisites

### NodeJS and Yarn

First install the LTS of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) which is `14.15.4` at the time of writing. NodeJS bundles `npm`.

Next install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```zsh
npm install -g yarn
```

### AvalancheGo and Avash

[AvalancheGo](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego) is our full node written in Golang. [Avash](https://docs.avax.network/build/tools/avash) is our local test network. Together, you can deploy private local networks and run tests on them.

### Solidity and Avalanche

It is also helpful to have a basic understanding of [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org) and [Avalanche](https://docs.avax.network).

## Dependencies

First clone this repo and download the necessary packages.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart.git
cd avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart
yarn
```

## Write Contracts

Edit the `Coin.sol` contract in `contracts/`. `Coin.sol` is an [Open Zeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com) [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) contract. ERC20 is a popular smart contract interface for interoperability. You can also add your own contracts.

## Building

In [`package.json`](./package.json) there's a `compile` script.

```json
"compile": "npx hardhat compile",
```

Run `yarn compile` to make sure your project compiles.

## Prepare to Deploy

Edit the deployment script in `scripts/deploy.js`

## Deploy

Hardhat enables deploying to multiple environments. In [`package.json`](./package.json) there are scripts for deploying to the [hardhat network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network), [avash](https://github.com/ava-labs/avash), `fuji` and `mainnet`.

```json
"deploy-hardhat-network": "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js",
"deploy-avash": "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network avash",
"deploy-fuji": "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network fuji",
"deploy": "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet",
```

Deploy your contract to the Avalanche `fuji` testnet with `yarn deploy-fuji`.

To deploy to avash, `fuji` or `mainnet` you need to add your private key(s) to the `accounts` field in [hardhat.config.js](./hardhat.config.js).

Then run `yarn deploy` for mainnet, `yarn deploy-fuji` for fuji, `yarn deploy-avash` for avash and `yarn deploy-hardhat-network` for the hardhat network.

## Hardhat Tasks

You can define custom hardhat tasks in [hardhat.config.js](./hardhat.config.js). There are two tasks included as examples&mdash;`accounts` and `balances` both of which have scripts in [package.json](./package.json).

```json
"accounts": "npx hardhat accounts",
"balances": "npx hardhat balances"
```

`yarn accounts` will print the list of accounts. `yarn balances` prints the list of AVAX account balances.

## Sending AVAX

[package.json](./package.json) has a `send-avax` script which is found in [scripts/sendAvax.js](./scripts/sendAvax.js).

```json
"send-avax": "npx hardhat run scripts/sendAvax.js",
```

Run it with `yarn send-avax`.

## Hardhat Help

You can run `yarn hardhat` to list hardhat version, usage instructions, global options and available tasks.

## Typical avash workflow

First confirm you have the latest and greatest AvalancheGo built.

```zsh
cd /path/to/avalanchego
git fetch -p
git checkout master
./scripts/build.sh
```

Next fire up avash and run a script to configure your network.

```zsh
cd /path/to/avash
git fetch -p
git checkout master
go build
 ./avash
Config file set: /Users/username/.avash.yaml
Avash successfully configured.
avash> runscript scripts/five_node_staking.lua
RunScript: Running scripts/five_node_staking.lua
RunScript: Successfully ran scripts/five_node_staking.lua
```

Now you have a local avalanche network with 5 staking nodes. Next transfer 1000 AVAX from the X-Chain to each of the 10 avash accounts in `hardhat.config.js`.

```zsh
cd /path/to/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart
yarn fund-cchain-addresses
yarn run v1.22.4
$ npx hardhat run scripts/fund-cchain-addresses.js --network avash
Exporting 1000 AVAX to each address on the C-Chain...

2dyXcQGiCk1ckCX4Fs8nLgL8GJgsM72f9Ga13rX5v9TAguVJYM
âœ¨  Done in 5.03s.
```

Confirm each of the accounts are funded with 1000 AVAX.

```zsh
yarn balances
yarn run v1.22.4
$ npx hardhat balances
